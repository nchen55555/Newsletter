                <p style="margin:0 0 12px 0;"> I rarely take inbound recruiter outreaches seriously, oftentimes because I know these recruiters are likely shipping out hundreds of emails each day to get a response from people and because none of these outreaches are personalized to me. I also don’t have the time to go research the companies or startups they represent. In fact, earlier this year, I got an email from a recruiter about a potential founding engineer role at Blockit. I replied out of curiosity, but didn’t follow up again: I didn’t have time to validate the opportunity.
                <br><br>
                That changed when Karen, a Harvard alum I’d heard about back in school, reached out a few days later. I decided to hop on a call with her, and soon after, with Kais and John, Blockit’s co-founders. Those conversations completely shifted my perspective on the company, and I’m super, super excited to be doing this company profile on them to share their vision, a vision that I strongly resonate with! In fact, after my call with Kais, I was on the verge of asking to join their team.
                <br><br>
                Blockit’s founder, Kais Khimji, first conceived the idea for Blockit during his sophomore year at Harvard. Over the years, he made several attempts to bring it to life but, as a Canadian founder, often ran into visa and immigration hurdles that made building in the U.S. difficult. After graduating, Kais joined Sequoia Capital as an investor. Yet his conviction in Blockit’s problem space never wavered, and ten years later, he has assembled a team of ten to bring this vision to life. What especially drew me in to Blockit’s vision wasn’t necessarily the idea itself but rather Kais as a founder. When asked about the team, Kais named every single member, highlighting their background and the intentionality behind each hire: Chung came from Waymo, one of the only AI applications that is currently stateful and can handle multi-player AI interactions which Blockit has been expanding into; Pruthvi was a new grad having interned at Notion and Asana and a desire to operate early-stage on cutting-edge technology; and Karen, with offers from Cursor and Mercor after graduating from Goldman’s TMT program, was chosen to lead and scale the company’s business operations.
               <h2 id="heading-0" style="margin:22px 0 10px 0;font-size:24px;line-height:32px;font-weight:500;">Blockit’s Virality and The Network Effects</h2>
              <p style="margin:0 0 12px 0;"> When Kais left his role at Sequoia Capital to build Blockit, he did so very quietly. In fact, his LinkedIn hasn’t updated yet, Karen’s LinkedIn is now completely gone, and John’s LinkedIn has an obscure “Member of Scheduling Staff” title. The reason for this stealth is because Sequoia’s name carries a heavy spotlight, and Kais didn’t want his departure to spark headlines or speculation before the product was ready. Ironically, while he was avoiding attention, Blockit began spreading entirely on its own.
