                <!-- My Introduction to Pathlight -->

                <p style="margin:0 0 12px 0;">  I recently connected with Tinah, co-founder of Andera, through the Neo network. She had reached out to a partner at Neo after checking out my profile on LinkedIn, and wanted to chat because of our mutual networks at Neo, our backgrounds at Stripe, and my general interest in FinTech. She and her co-founder Aryo, both MIT graduates, founded Andera in 2024 and, after raising their seed round, were eager to expand the team. We hopped on a call and what started off as a casual chat became the foundation for Andera’s partnership with The Niche.
                <br><br>
                I’m especially excited to be writing Andera’s company profile because of two main reasons. First, Tinah’s clarity of vision and thoughtful approach to execution. While I’m not as familiar with the compliance industry, which is Andera’s core focus, our conversations made it clear that Tinah and her team have a deep understanding of the space, a strong sense of direction, and a level of operational focus that’s rare among founders.
                <br><br>
                Second, almost all of The Niche is highly technical and through talking with Tinah, I know that many in the network would be extremely excited about the types of cutting-edge technical problems Andera is trying to tackle in the ML space. The team is building models that can parse and reason over messy, multimodal financial data, from PDFs and spreadsheets to internal documents and emails, and translate that into structured, auditable insight. For MLEs, this means working on core challenges in data representation, context engineering, and model evaluation that sit at the heart of where AI is heading today.

              <p style="margin:0 0 12px 0;"> I started off the conversation with trying to get a better understanding of the SOX compliance (pronounced “socks”) industry in which Andera operates. SOX refers to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, a federal law enacted in 2002 in response to a series of accounting scandals, most notably the infamous Enron scandal. Enron, once the seventh-largest company in the U.S., was exposed for massively inflating its reported financials. It was hiding billions in debt and inflating profits by billions. Stock prices were overvalued and when the truth came out, the company and its equities collapsed almost within a month. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act was created to restore confidence in corporate financial reporting, requiring public companies to maintain transparent internal processes and submit to independent audits to ensure the accuracy and integrity of their financial statements.
