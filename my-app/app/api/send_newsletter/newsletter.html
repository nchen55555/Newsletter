                  <em><strong>TLDR</strong> - Crosby's partnership with The Niche is a rare chance to get involved with an AI-native startup that just emerged from stealth and is hiring a select few interns and new grads on a bet for exceptional early talent. Ryan and John, the co-founders of Crosby, have deep knowledge within the law and ML space, with John having led Ramp's early technical efforts to scale and Ryan, a certified lawyer, having worked at big-name law corporations as well as at startups scaling their legal division. Crosby isn't like other AI-native tooling within the legal service. It's the first AI-based law firm to ever launch. </em>

                <p style="margin:0 0 12px 0;">  When The Niche was first starting out, I remember the looming anxiety of drafting my very first contract agreement to send to a partner firm. With limited resources, no background in law, and nothing but an overworked ChatGPT subscription, I turned to OpenAI to help draft that first agreement. Today, that process looks entirely different and sending out contracts has become part of the business. Still, I can only imagine how challenging it is for other startups and new businesses to access affordable, fast, and reliable legal support.
                  <br><br>
                That’s why Crosby Legal’s recent seed raise, backed by Sequoia and BCV, and emergence from stealth in June 2025 immediately caught my attention. I had heard of successful startups like Harvey AI which built the tooling for law firms to do legal work more efficiently by automating certain processes with AI, so I was curious how Crosby would be different. In fact, from a cursory glance, I wasn’t sure there was much of a difference. When I sifted through Crosby’s early hires, I was even more confused. The startup had attracted some incredible top-notch talent, including one of my friends who happened to interview there, so what was the company betting on that was different from existing solutions and able to attract so many smart people?
                <br><br>
                I got a chance to answer that question when I met Ryan, co-founder and CEO of Crosby, and Hana, Chief of Staff at Crosby, in person at their office last week. The first question I asked Ryan was how Crosby differentiates itself from other AI-startups building the automation tools for law firms.
